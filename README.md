    Connects to the database: It establishes a connection to a MySQL database named shop_db, using the username root and an empty password (standard settings for a local development server, e.g., XAMPP or MAMP).

    Requests products: It executes an SQL query SELECT * FROM products to retrieve all records (products) from the products table.

    Initializes a user: It sets the variable $user_id = 1;. This is a temporary solution ("temporary demo user") to associate products added to the cart with a specific user (in this case, with ID=1). In a real application, there would be an authentication system here.

    Displays an HTML page: It generates HTML markup for the web page.

        Header and styles: Includes the title "Product Catalog", links the Bootstrap CSS framework for styling, and Bootstrap Icons. It also contains a <style> block with custom CSS rules to enhance the appearance (background, margins, effects for product cards).

        Page title: Displays the heading "Product Catalog" with a shop icon.

        Loop for displaying products:

            It uses a while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) loop to iterate over each product retrieved from the database.

            For each product ($row), a card (Bootstrap card) is created.

            Product image: The product image is displayed. The image path is formed as images/ + the filename from the image_url field in the database (e.g., images/product1.jpg).

            Product name: The product name from the name field is displayed.

            Product price: The price from the price field is displayed with the currency "TMT" appended.

            Form for adding to cart: For each product, a separate HTML form is created:

                action="add_to_cart.php": Specifies that the form data will be sent to the add_to_cart.php script.

                method="post": The data will be sent using the POST method.

                Hidden fields:

                    <input type="hidden" name="product_id" value="<?php echo $row['id']; ?>">: Transmits the ID of the current product.

                    <input type="hidden" name="user_id" value="<?php echo $user_id; ?>">: Transmits the user ID (always 1 in this case).

                Quantity field: Allows the user to select the quantity of the product to add to the cart (defaults to 1, minimum 1).

                "Add to Cart" button: When clicked, sends the form data (product ID, user ID, quantity) to the server to the add_to_cart.php script.

        Link to cart: At the bottom of the page, there's a button-link "Go to Cart" that leads to the cart.php page.

    Includes Bootstrap JS: At the end of the document, the Bootstrap JavaScript file is included, which is necessary for some interactive Bootstrap components to work (although they are not explicitly used in this specific code, it's standard practice).

How it works (execution flow):

    User request: The user opens this PHP page in their browser.

    Server-side execution:

        The web server (e.g., Apache with PHP) starts executing the PHP code.

        The PHP script connects to MySQL.

        The SQL query is executed, and the results (list of products) are stored in the $result variable.

        PHP starts generating HTML code.

        When PHP encounters the while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()): loop, it sequentially fetches each row (product) from $result.

        For each row, it inserts the field values ($row['image_url'], $row['name'], $row['price'], $row['id']) into the corresponding places in the HTML template of the product card.

        Thus, for each product from the database, its own HTML block (product card) is created with its data and an "add to cart" form.

    Sending to client: After all PHP code is executed, the generated HTML page (now with all product data) is sent to the user's browser.

    Display in browser:

        The browser receives the HTML code.

        It loads the CSS files (Bootstrap and custom styles) and applies them, styling the page.

        It displays the product catalog as cards.

    User interaction:

        The user sees the list of products.

        They can change the quantity for any product.

        When the user clicks the "Add to Cart" button for a specific product, the browser sends data from the corresponding form (product ID, user ID, quantity) to the server, to the add_to_cart.php page (the logic of this script is not shown here, but it should process this data and add the product to the user's cart in the database).

        The user can click the "Go to Cart" button to navigate to the cart.php page (whose logic is also not shown here, but it should display the items added to the cart).

Key points:

    Dynamic content generation: The catalog content is generated based on data from the database, not hardcoded in HTML.

    Separation of logic and presentation: PHP is responsible for logic (data retrieval), and HTML/CSS for presentation (how it looks).

    Use of Bootstrap: Simplifies the creation of a responsive and attractive interface.

    Forms for interaction: Allow the user to send data to the server (e.g., to add a product to the cart).

What is missing in this code (but implied for full functionality):

    add_to_cart.php file: A script that handles adding a product to the cart (writes information to the database, session, or cookie).

    cart.php file: A script that displays the contents of the user's cart.

    images/ folder: With product image files, whose names are specified in the image_url field of the products table.

    The shop_db database itself with a products table (with at least id, name, price, image_url fields).

    A more robust user authentication system (instead of $user_id = 1;).
